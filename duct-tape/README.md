# darlingserver Duct Taping

The purpose of this subproject is to use a significantly stripped down version of XNU's own kernel code coupled with some glue/duct-tape code to simulate the necessary parts of a normal XNU kernel environment for the code to work properly to implement things like Mach IPC.
